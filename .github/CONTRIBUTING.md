# How to Contribute
For contribute at this project, open an Issue or a Pull request.

### Rules to Code

* For indentation, use Tabs instead Spaces (1 Tab = 4 Spaces)
* For the strings delimiter, use `'`, except when is needed to expanse some variables
* Comment all the function with extreme precision
* For a readable code, insert a blank line after each construct (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) and between pieces of code with different scopes
